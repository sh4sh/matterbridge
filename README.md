matterbridge is a solution to connect users on different platforms/protocols, allowing them to chat in the best conditions possible. Despite the name, Matter<em>most</em> isn't required to run matter<em>bridge</em>.

> [!WARNING]
> This fork has edited the history of the project to remove ~100MB of vendoring.
> This will faciliate review of new PRs, see [community/#5](https://github.com/matterbridge-org/community/issues/5)
> for the reasons why we did this and how to make sure we didn't introduce backdoors in this process.

## Features

Many features are available, but not all of them are supported on all protocols:

- [x] Bridge many rooms from supported protocols
- [x] Message threads/topics, and replies
- [x] Attachments, file uploads, and inline images
- [x] Transparent bridging with spoofed usernames and avatars
- [x] Private groups

**The complete and up-to-date list of supported protocols is in [docs/protocols/](docs/protocols/).** Additionally, we have an [API for 3rd party integration](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/wiki/Features#api) if you'd like to add a custom bridge without implementing it in this codebase.

This project is licensed under the [GNU AGPLv3 license](LICENSE) since after commit `20988f6446c6ad3ea416044712e634d3ed85ee53`. It was relicensed following discussion in [commmunity/#10](https://github.com/matterbridge-org/community/issues/10). Apart from the obvious advantages of copyleft to promote innovation and cooperation, in very practical terms, we had to use either `GPL` or `AGPL` to include the `whatsappmulti` bridge in official builds and deprecate the broken legacy `whatsapp` bridge. When contributing to matterbridge development, you agree that your contributions will be published under that license.
